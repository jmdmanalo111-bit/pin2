  <h1>Case Law – Fraud and Major Flaws You Must Avoid</h1>
  <p>PIN Valuations • Eric Jordan, CPPA</p>
</header>
<main class="wrap">

  <section class="card">
    <p>The copyrighted and proprietary Eric Jordan “25 Factors Affecting Business Valuation” methodology is strong and accurate. Combined with our new in‑house marketing methodology, clients can expect to sell their business almost 100% of the time at or near our valuation price. <strong>(We have past and ongoing proof.)</strong></p>

    <h2>We Solve</h2>
    <p>Partnership disputes, divorce issues, purchase and sale values, share value, CRA Section 86 estate freezes, Section 85 rollovers, income valuations, and expropriation cases.</p>

    <h2>Why Our Valuations Work</h2>
    <p>A business that can be financed is a business that can be sold. Our valuation reports have been used by clients to secure 85% financing at the lowest possible rates—results not possible with most other valuation reports.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Major Flaws in Traditional Valuation Approaches</h2>
    <p>Market, Asset, and Income approaches are fundamentally flawed and can lead to financial loss and legal risk.</p>

    <h3>1. Market Approach</h3>
    <p>Market approach relies on private sale data that often reflects forced sale prices. These are <em>not</em> fair market value transactions and should never be used as comparables.</p>
    <div class="note"><strong>Fair Market Value Definition:</strong> The price expressed in money that a knowledgeable buyer and seller would agree upon, with both parties having reasonable knowledge of the facts, acting in their own interests, and neither being under any pressure to buy or to sell.</div>

    <h3>2. Asset Approach</h3>
    <p>The asset approach is outdated. Tangible assets usually represent only about 10% of business value (see Ocean Tomo report). Intangible assets—which drive most business value—are neglected in this method.</p>

    <h3>3. Income Approach</h3>
    <p>Income approach methodology was proven outdated in 2009, when Mark D. Wiseman and the Canadian Pension Plan invested in Skype at $300M USD despite negative income. Two years later, they sold at over $1B USD. An income‑approach valuator would have missed this opportunity entirely.</p>

    <p>The Eric Jordan “25 Factors” methodology follows the venture capitalist model, accounting properly for intangible assets and fair market realities.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Proof of Concept</h2>
    <p>Our valuations are so accurate they can reveal the profile of who would buy your business, even if it is not currently for sale. This unique capability is confirmed by AI analysis.</p>

    <h2>Misleading and Fraudulent Valuations</h2>
    <p>While 98% of accountants are trustworthy, about 2% perform valuations without the proper experience or methodology. Some brokers and agents also misuse outdated approaches. This can result in undervaluations or even fraud.</p>

    <h3>Example (2023)</h3>
    <p>Our valuation: $2.7M. The client wanted a lower number, which we could not ethically provide. They then found a “certified” valuator using outdated 1970s methods to produce a value 38.19% lower. Presenting that report while hiding ours could constitute fraud.</p>
  </section>
