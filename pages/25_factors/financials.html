                <h2>Eric Jordan’s “25 Factors Affecting Business Valuation”</h2>
                <p>Mark D Wiseman has been added to a list of the top 150 Venture Capitalists in the world (Researched in March 2025) none of whom are accountants.</p>
                <p>The 150 top Venture Capitalists in the world who value some of the world's most valuable companies should be considered the world’s best valuation experts. And again, none of them, to the best of our research, are accountants. Does anyone seriously think these top experts would employ the old hard asset, income, or market approach to business valuation used by most accountant based valuators today? Ask Warren Buffet?</p>
                <p>Venture Capitalists use honest accountants to supply reliable financial data that has generally been arranged for tax purposes. Clients have already paid these accountants tens of thousands of dollars to produce these documents that are generally needed to start a valuation.</p>
                <p>This is also the basis of Eric Jordan’s “25 Factors Affecting Business Valuation” methodology. Honest Accountants produce the financial records required to start the valuation process. This is where, in private company valuations, experienced business owner/operators take over. These people with 15 years or more of relevant business owner/operator experience, are trained in the use of Eric Jordan’s “25 Factors Affecting Business Valuation”. They identify, measure, weigh, and put an estimated value on the intangible assets that make up the majority of most company value since at least 2009. This is when the Mark D Wiseman/Skype moment changed business valuation history.</p>
                <p>Clients have paid their accountants tens and sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars for accounting. We trust these professionals for accounting and tax purposes; but not for business valuation.</p>
                <div class="callout"><strong>None</strong> of the top 150 valuators in the world are accountants.</div>
            </section>

            <!-- REPLACED: Purpose section → New History section provided by user -->
            <section id="history">
                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>There is no math or accounting formula that measures and weighs the value of history in business valuations. In the absence of any formula there can only be experience.</p>
                <p>It takes a lot of experience for the stone mason to know where to hit the rock and how often and with what tool and with what force; to have the perfect building stone drop off. An entrepreneurial business owner operator with enough relevant experience is going to be able to chip away objectively at the history in a company, know what questions to ask, and be able to make fair and balanced judgments on what weight to give the unique history of the subject company's "fair market value" as required by the Canada Income Tax Act and the CRA Policy Paper.</p>
                <p>An experienced valuator with relevant owner operator experience can evaluate the historical performance of a business, identifying trends and patterns that may impact its future value. This understanding is essential for providing context and insights into the company's trajectory.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, accountants might not possess the necessary operational and industry expertise to evaluate the historical performance of a business, which could result in a limited understanding of trends and patterns impacting its future value.</p>
                <p>Accountants focused on the income approach may overlook the long-term trends and patterns that impact a business's value, as their primary concern is the company's financial performance.</p>
                <p>Business brokers might lack the depth of operational and industry expertise necessary to evaluate a business's historical performance, resulting in a limited understanding of trends and patterns that impact its future value.</p>
                <p>Historical performance might not be fully considered in sale price data, as it may focus on recent financial figures and overlook the long-term trends and patterns that impact a business's value.</p>
                <div class="callout">This proves why Eric Jordan’s “25 Factors Affecting Business Valuation” methodology combined with 15 years or more of business owner operator experience produces the most accurate option for all stakeholders. This methodology is proving to be “disruptive” in the valuation industry.</div>
                <h3>Why would you accept a valuation from a broker or accountant using flawed data?</h3>
                <p>Hard Asset Approach, Income Approach, and Market Approaches to business valuation should never be accepted in 2025 when we know better. These are approaches used by unscrupulous agents and others using inaccurate data and accounting formulas to suggest a business value that might fit well into their business plan; but not yours.</p>
                <h3>Venture Capitalists Are the Valuers of the Biggest Companies</h3>
                <p>Venture Capitalists are the valuers of the biggest companies in the world. Think Peter Thiel.</p>
                <p>Neither Peter Thiel, Elon Musk or any of the other top 150 Venture Capitalists in the world are accountants or real estate agents.</p>
                <p>The biggest and best companies in the world are not trusting accountants or realtors for valuation purposes; why would you?</p>
                <p>Trust your local accountant who sticks to accounting. That is who we depend upon to start your valuation process.</p>
                <div class="callout">“None of the top 150 valuators in the world are accountants.”</div>
                <p>The top business valuators in the world are Venture Capitalists like Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, and our Canadian example Mark D Wiseman.</p>
                <p>Of the 200,000 honest, hard working, professional accountants in Canada; less than 1% suggest they can do business valuations.</p>
                <p>We believe this radical 1% of would-be monopolists have no business doing business valuations in 2025 using outdated, unreliable, misleading and dishonest approaches to business valuation. These outdated approaches are: Hard Asset, Income and Market approaches to business valuation.</p>
                <h3>Case Study: Mark D. Wiseman &amp; Skype (2009)</h3>
                <p>Those 1% and their methodology was proven wrong in 2009 by Mark D Wiseman and the Canadian Pension Plan Fund.</p>
                <p>Canadian Venture Capitalist Mark D Wiseman, working with the Canadian Pension Plan, valued a block of shares of a company that had financial statements showing huge losses (SKYPE), and purchased that block at $300 MILLION USD. Mark D Wiseman was also instrumental in selling that same block of shares for well over a BILLION USD two years later.</p>
                <p>That day in 2009 was the day when accounting based valuators had their methodology turned on its head.</p>
                <h3>Why Traditional Approaches Fail</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>(1) The hard asset approach to business valuation was proven wrong and outdated as hard assets are a very small percentage of the average company value and especially by 2025. Skype had few hard assets.</li>
                    <li>(2) The Income approach to business valuation they used was proven not well supported, misleading, and wildly inaccurate. Skype had negative income.</li>
                    <li>(3) The market approach to business valuation shows valuators even today (2025) are relying mainly on unverified, inadequate, incomplete, and misleading private company sale data.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Mark D Wiseman has been added to a list of the top 150 Venture Capitalists in the world (Researched in March 2025) NONE OF WHOM are accountants.</p>
                <p>The 150 top Venture Capitalists in the world who value some of the world's most valuable companies should be considered the world’s best valuation experts. And again, none of them, to the best of our research, are accountants.

                <h2>Financials</h2>
                <p>Financial documents of a company prepared for tax filing purposes is the purview of accounting professionals who have the relevant training and experience for that work. Normalizing financial documents prepared for tax purposes for use in a business valuation; requires an entrepreneurial valuator with prior long term relevant business owner operator experience An entrepreneurial valuator has no doubt bought and sold Intangible Assets. This is what gives them the extra experience required to normalize assets to correctly determine “fair market value” as required in the Canada Income Tax Act and the CRA Policy Paper.</p>
                <p>Business experience is going to suggest to the entrepreneurial valuator that the balance sheet inventory of boats in late September will need to be discounted as opposed to a May 1 effective date of valuation. Relevant business experience is going to help the entrepreneurial valuator to effectively and accurately determine and adjust fair market wages in the normalization process for the profit and loss statement. These are just two of the many normalizations that are the purview of entrepreneurial business valuator.</p>
                <p>Valuators with hands-on experience in managing a company's financials can effectively analyze balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements. This analysis is critical for determining a business's financial health and growth potential.</p>
                <p>While accountants excel at analyzing financial statements, they may not have the practical business experience to interpret the results in the context of the company's operations and industry.</p>
                <p>Accountants are experts in financial analysis, using the income approach alone might not capture the full context of a company's operations and industry, resulting in potentially misleading comparisons between businesses.</p>
                <p>While brokers may have a basic understanding of financial statements, they may not possess the in-depth knowledge and experience required to accurately interpret the results in the context of the company's operations and industry.</p>
                <p>Sale price data may include financial information, it might not capture the full context of a company's operations and industry, leading to potentially misleading comparisons between businesses.</p>

                <p>Neither Peter Thiel, Elon Musk or any of the other top 150 Venture Capitalists in the world are accountants or real estate agents.</p>
                <p>The biggest and best companies in the world are not trusting accountants or realtors for valuation purposes; WHY WOULD YOU?</p>
                <p>Trust your local accountant who sticks to accounting. That is who we depend upon to start your valuation process.</p>
                <div class="callout">“None of the top 150 valuators in the world are accountants.”</div>
                <p>The top business valuators in the world are Venture Capitalists like Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, and our Canadian example Mark D Wiseman.</p>
                <p>Of the 200,000 honest, hard working, professional accountants in Canada; less than 1% suggest they can do business valuations.</p>
                <p>We believe this radical 1% of would be monopolists have no business doing business valuations in 2025 using outdated, unreliable, misleading and dishonest approaches to business valuation. These outdated approaches are: Hard Asset, Income and Market approaches to business valuation.</p>
                <h3>Case Study: Mark D. Wiseman &amp; Skype (2009)</h3>
                <p>Those 1% and their methodology was proven wrong in 2009 by Mark D Wiseman and the Canadian Pension Plan Fund.</p>
                <p>Canadian Venture Capitalist Mark D Wiseman, working with the Canadian Pension Plan, valued a block of shares of a company that had financial statements showing huge losses (SKYPE), and purchased that block at $300 MILLION USD. Mark D Wiseman was also instrumental in selling that same block of shares for well over a BILLION USD two years later.</p>
                <p>That day in 2009 was the day when accounting based valuators had their methodology turned on its head.</p>
                <h3>Why Traditional Approaches Fail</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>(1) The hard asset approach to business valuation was proven wrong and outdated as hard assets are a very small percentage of the average company value and especially by 2025. Skype had few hard assets.</li>
                    <li>(2) The Income approach to business valuation they used was proven not well supported, misleading, and wildly inaccurate. Skype had negative income.</li>
                    <li>(3) The market approach to business valuation shows valuators even today (2025) are relying mainly on unverified, inadequate, incomplete, and misleading private company sale data.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Mark D Wiseman has been added to a list of the top 150 Venture Capitalists in the world (Researched in March 2025) NONE OF WHOM are accountants.</p>
                <p>The 150 top Venture Capitalists in the world who value some of the world's most valuable companies should be considered the world’s best valuation experts. And again, none of them, to the best of our research, are accountants. Does anyone seriously think these top experts would employ the old hard asset, income, or market approach to business valuation used by most accountant based valuators today? Ask Warren Buffet?</p>
                <p>Venture Capitalists use honest accountants to supply reliable financial data that has generally been arranged for tax purposes. Clients have already paid these accountants tens of thousands of dollars to produce these documents that are generally needed to start a valuation.</p>
                <p>This is also the basis of Eric Jordan’s “25 Factors Affecting Business Valuation” methodology. Honest Accountants produce the financial records required to start the valuation process. This is where, in private company valuations, experienced business owner/operators take over. These people with 15 years or more of relevant business owner/operator experience, are trained in the use of Eric Jordan’s “25 Factors Affecting Business Valuation”. They identify, measure, weigh, and put an estimated value on the intangible assets that make up the majority of most company value since at least 2009. This is when the Mark D Wiseman/Skype moment changed business valuation history.</p>
                <p>Clients have paid their accountants tens and sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars for accounting. We trust these professionals FOR ACCOUNTING AND TAX PURPOSES; but NOT for Business Valuation.</p>
                <p>NONE of the top 150 valuators in the world are accountants.</p>
